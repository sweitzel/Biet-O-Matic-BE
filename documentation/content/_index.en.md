# Welcome

Welcome to the Biet-O-Matic Browser extension, in the following simply called "BE".
Please use the navigation menu on the left to access the desired information.

If you like, you can skip to a [Quick-Start Guide]({{< relref "/manual#quick-start" >}}) which gives important information about the basic usage of BE.

## Origin
First of all: Biet-O-Matic BE and the [Original B-O-M Program](https://www.bid-o-matic.org/hp/) have little in common except for the name:

- Another developer
- Completely different technology
  - Original B-O-M is a Windows program, programmed in Visual Basic.
  - BE is a stand-alone browser extension programmed in JavaScript.
- BE has a reduced functional scope - it focuses on item management and automatic bidding.

At mid/end 2019 the original B-O-M program stopped working reliably due to changes made by eBay regarding login/captcha.
There were no reliable and sustainable efforts to address these issues in the original program. 
So - without much hesitation - this project was created to provide a free replacement for B-O-M.

A short research about alternatives did not lead to satisfying results:

- Not trustworthy nor professional looking "quick fix solutions"
- Solutions which one immediately notices that it is primarily about being a source of income for the author
- Problems in terms of data protection:
  - Entrusting login data to a third party provider
  - Source code not available
- Unclear situation regarding the access, storage and evaluation of transaction data (auctions)

## Bid-O-Matic Forum
If you want to ask questions about the programme - be it about a problem,
a proposal or anything else - you can do so in the [B-O-M Forum](https://www.bid-o-matic.org/forum/index.php?c=6).

Please note:
- For inquiries please check first if this or a similar inquiry already existed
- Please always place new requests in separate "Topics" and in the correct category 

## Source code
The source code of B-O-M BE is available at www.github.com/sweitzel/Biet-O-Matic-BE.
It is also possible to request changes to the source code directly via "Pull Requests".
You can report problems with BE on GitHub, which probably leads to a better order and clarity
(a forum is not a problem/ticket management system).

The source code is under the [Apache Lizenz](https://github.com/sweitzel/Biet-O-Matic-BE/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Donations
B-O-M BE was created as a spare-time project and in a relatively short time. However, in order to support the continued
support or even the implementation of new functions in the longer term, the "donation function" is offered as a
financing option.

Likewise a donation can also be considered as a small gift or a thank you, which I am of course very happy about.

### Paypal
A quick and uncomplicated donation is possible via my [PayPal Profile](https://paypal.me/weitzels?locale.x=en_US).

### GitHub
Sponsoring through GitHub is a relatively new way to fund open source projects through a community and generate
predictable income. It's more complicated for the "sponsor", but it does generate more predictable cash flow,
which is necessary to keep such a project alive. Here is the GitHub link to donate.

- Recommended only for software engineers or similar people, who already own a GitHub account.
- Requires a registration at GitHub (which is free)
- Donations can only be made as recurring payments. So the chosen amount will be debited monthly (but this can also be revoked monthly)
