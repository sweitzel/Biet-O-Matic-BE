# Privacy
B-O-M BE has been designed to minimize the impact on the data belonging to the BE users:

## Internet Communication
> B-O-M BE does not send any personal, statistical or eBay-platform specific data to servers on the Internet!

BE only uses the existing communication channels - i.e. from the user's device to the eBay platform to bid for
or manage the items selected by the user.

## eBay Username & Password
> B-O-M BE does not need your eBay user credentials!

BE requires that the user has already registered and logged in an official eBay page in the same browser where BE
is installed. This logon is usually stored indefinitely as long as you use eBay from case to case.

## Data collection
> B-O-M BE or the manufacturer of the extension do not collect any data from the user!
> Also no evaluation software - Google Analytics or similar - is used.

No personal data is collected:

* User names or other personal identifiers are neither collected nor stored.
* Auction details are only stored locally on the user's computer (event logs).
* Information about stored items is only stored on the user's computer, and as part of the
  session synchronization provided by the browser manufacturer.
